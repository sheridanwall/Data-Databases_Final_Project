# Data-Databases_Final_Project
Final project for Data and Databases course

This is the final project for the Data and Databases course completed as part of the M.S. Data Journalism Program at Columbia University. For this project, I analyzed the transcripts of all oral arguments presented in front of the Supreme Court in 2019. I scraped the text of each transcript from the Supreme Court's website. I then cleaned and analyzed the text with regular expressions, focusing specifically on Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's remarks throughout each oral argument. Finally, I mapped each case by its federal circuit court of origin using Google Earthâ€™s API.

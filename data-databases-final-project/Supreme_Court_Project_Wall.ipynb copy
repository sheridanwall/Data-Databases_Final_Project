    "## Supreme Court Project Guide\n",
    "\n",
    "The ultimate goal of this project is to build a database of Supreme Court cases for 2019 (or a different range of years) that includes the dialogue from the oral arguments of each case. As we have seen in class the arguments were scraped from this page: https://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcript.aspx \n",
    "\n",
    "I have already downloaded and transformed the PDFs of the transcripts into text documents which you can download from courseworks: supreme_court_pdfs_txt.zip\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three primary programmatic steps that you need to complete:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Please note:** Step 3 is the most challenging--if you want to spend some time coding, you can skip Steps 1 and 2 and get to work on Step 3\n",
    "\n",
    "**STEP 1:** scrape all of the case information available on this page: https://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcript/2019\n",
    "\n",
    "This should include case name, docket number, etc--and most importantly the name of the PDF file. All of the text files share the exact same name as the PDF files they came from. This file name will allow you to connect your transcription data with your case data. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is up to you what kind data structure you want to build. But it likely to be a list of lists, or list of dictionaries--for each case you will have a list or dictionary of the information you scrape from the webpage.\n",
    "\n",
    "**STEP 2:** find secondary source(s) to scrape/integrate with your case data. The information on the Supreme Court page is very limited. You need to find a source or group of sources that ad information. The most important information would likely be: the decision, who voted for and against, and the district court origin of the case (for geocoding). You might think of other great things to put in there too! This information needs to be merged with the data you have from STEP 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "**STEP 3:** use regular expressions to clean up and parse the text files so that you have a searchable data structure containing the dialog from the transcripts. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Architecture** \n",
    "You will need to think about how you will set up, separate, and join different tables that you create. The initial scraping will give you very simple dataframe: the columns will be dockett, case name, date argued, and PDF name. The regex work on the PDFs should result in a very simple table (or just a list of tuples) of speaker name and dialogue. \n",
    "\n",
    "`[('MR. BERGERON',\" Yes. That's essentially the same thing\"),('JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR',' So how do you deal with Chambers?')]`\n",
    "\n",
    "But make sure you attach the docket number or pdf filename to each set of arguments transform using regex. Your secondary sources and information should be linked by docket number, but the question is how to set up those data frames, join them, aggregate them, and narrow them to the fields necessary for presentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Go step-by-step through this, and DM me on Slack whenever you get stuck, and I will help. If you complete all the steps before Thursday, Slack me if you want to go further.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interpretive Architecture**\n",
    "Also consider what kind of interpretive categories you can add through your reading and research. At the very least, it is recommended that you come up with categories for the kinds of cases that are before the court: human clustering for meaning is always more effective than computational clustering. Try to come up with perhaps 8 to 10 domains that groups of cases might belong to. But also think of other ways of categorizing these cases or these decisions--by politics, by consequences on citizens (you could make a scale from 1 to 10), even an aggregated index of consequences/effects on different types of communities, sectors, regions, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "You are the researcher, these categories or ways of expressing your point-of-view.\n",

DEREK SCHMIDT \\n\\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER \\n\\nGENERAL SCHMIDT: Mr. Chief Justice, \\n\\nand may it please the Court: \\n\\nIn a typical and recent year, more \\n\\nthan 15 million Americans became victims of \\n\\nidentity theft. One-third of those had their \\n\\npersonal information misused in an employment or \\n\\ntax-related fraud setting. \\n\\nMany of those victims were left to \\n\\nuntangle reputations, eligibilities, and other \\n\\nfinances. That is why Kansas, like every other \\n\\nstate, makes identity theft a crime. Our laws \\n\\napply in all settings to all people, citizen and \\n\\nalien alike. \\n\\nRespondents were convicted because \\n\\nthey stole other people\\'s personal information \\n\\nwith intent to defraud. But, in Respondents\\' \\n\\nview, these state criminal laws that govern \\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation \\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n  \\n\\n \\n                                                                   \\n \\n \\n              \\n \\n              \\n \\n              \\n \\n              \\n \\n              \\n \\n              \\n \\n              \\n \\n              \\n \\n              \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n              \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n              \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n\\n1  \\n\\n2  \\n\\n3  \\n\\n4  \\n\\n5  \\n\\n6  \\n\\n7  \\n\\n8  \\n\\n9  \\n\\n10  \\n\\n11  \\n\\n12  \\n\\n13  \\n\\n14  \\n\\n15  \\n\\n16  \\n\\n17  \\n\\n18  \\n\\n19  \\n\\n20  \\n\\n21  \\n\\n22  \\n\\n23  \\n\\n24  \\n\\n25  \\n\\n4 \\n\\nOfficial \\n\\neverybody else do not apply to them. They argue \\n\\nthat Congress has, in effect, granted them \\n\\nspecial immunity because their intent was to \\n\\nobtain employment that Congress has forbidden. \\n\\nThis Court never has so held and \\n\\nshould not now. The conflict fatal to the \\n\\nArizona employment statute is not present here, \\n\\nbecause Kansas prohibits the theft of personal \\n\\ninformation by anybody, not work by unauthorized \\n\\naliens. And this Court has identified no \\n\\npreempted field relevant here. \\n\\nSection 1324a(b)(5) means what it says \\n\\nand no more. The I-9 verification system is \\n\\navailable only for specified federal uses. \\n\\n(b)(5)\\'s use limitation, which is quite \\n\\ndifferent from typical preemption provisions, is \\n\\none of several safeguards Congress adopted in \\n\\n1986 to limit both governments\\' and employers\\' \\n\\nuse of the then novel I-9 system. \\n\\nBut traditional state criminal law \\n\\nstill reaches misconduct elsewhere in the \\n\\nemployment context if proven without use of the \\n\\nI-9 system.

That\\'s why \\n\\nthey put the safeguards in. \\n\\nThe distinction, we believe, that\\'s \\n\\nbeen drawn is between the I-9 system itself, \\n\\nwhich Congress created and placed off limits, \\n\\nand the broader employment hiring context, which \\n\\nstates have traditionally been able to reach and \\n\\nwe believe still can reach. \\n\\nAnd so, in the question that Your \\n\\nHonor has posed, the fact that documents might \\n\\nbe submitted at the same time all for a purpose \\n\\nof obtaining a job does not transform tax \\n\\nwithholding forms or any other hiring documents \\n\\nlike a resume, a job application, a background \\n\\ncheck form, into part of the I-9 system. \\n\\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: May I --\\n\\nGENERAL SCHMIDT: And that system is \\n\\nwhat\\'s permitted. \\n\\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Can I unpackage \\n\\nyour argument a little bit?

MICHEL: Mr. Chief Justice, and \\n\\nmay it please the Court: \\n\\nRespondents stole the identity \\n\\ninformation of others and passed it off as their \\n\\nown on tax withholding forms. There\\'s no \\n\\ndispute that states could traditionally \\n\\nprosecute frauds and forgeries of that kind. \\n\\nThe question is whether Congress \\n\\nwithdrew that authority when it passed IRCA in \\n\\n1986.  Congress did not. IRCA is an immigration \\n\\nstatute. It set up a new system -- that\\'s the \\n\\nemployment verification system -- precisely to \\n\\nverify whether employees have work authorization \\n\\nas a matter of federal immigration law. \\n\\nNow IRCA put express limits on the use \\n\\nof the form that employees submit to document \\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation \\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n  \\n\\n \\n                                                                  \\n \\n \\n              \\n \\n              \\n \\n               \\n \\n              \\n \\n                      \\n \\n              \\n \\n              \\n \\n              \\n \\n              \\n \\n              \\n \\n              \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n\\n1  \\n\\n2  \\n\\n3  \\n\\n4  \\n\\n5      \\n\\n6  \\n\\n7  \\n\\n8  \\n\\n9  \\n\\n10  \\n\\n11  \\n\\n12  \\n\\n13  \\n\\n14  \\n\\n15  \\n\\n16  \\n\\n17  \\n\\n18  \\n\\n19  \\n\\n20  \\n\\n21  \\n\\n22  \\n\\n23  \\n\\n24  \\n\\n25  \\n\\n22 \\n\\nOfficial \\n\\ntheir work authorization.

MICHEL: I think it\\'s the \\n\\ndistinction -- and this is a critical one --\\n\\nbetween work authorization, which is a defined \\n\\n-- which is a term of art under immigration law, \\n\\nin IRCA, and general requirements for obtaining \\n\\na job, such as submitting a tax withholding \\n\\nform, submitting a background check. Those are \\n\\ntwo quite different things. \\n\\nIRCA is an immigration -- as I said at \\n\\nthe outset, an immigration statute that deals \\n\\nwith work authorization to work in the United \\n\\nStates. There are other requirements of law. \\n\\nFor example, 26 U.S.C. 3402 requires a tax \\n\\nwithholding form. But that has nothing to do \\n\\nwith work authorization.  Regardless of your \\n\\nwork authorization status, you still have to \\n\\nsubmit a tax withholding form. \\n\\nAnd I think one way to illustrate the \\n\\ndistinction is that a U.S. citizen, who has \\n\\nundoubted work authorization, could submit the \\n\\nsame materials that were submitted here, a false \\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation \\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n  \\n\\n \\n                                                                  \\n \\n \\n                \\n \\n              \\n \\n              \\n \\n              \\n \\n              \\n \\n              \\n \\n              \\n \\n              \\n \\n               \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n               \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n              \\n\\n1  \\n\\n2  \\n\\n3  \\n\\n4  \\n\\n5  \\n\\n6  \\n\\n7  \\n\\n8  \\n\\n9  \\n\\n10  \\n\\n11  \\n\\n12  \\n\\n13  \\n\\n14  \\n\\n15  \\n\\n16  \\n\\n17  \\n\\n18  \\n\\n19  \\n\\n20  \\n\\n21  \\n\\n22  \\n\\n23  \\n\\n24  \\n\\n25  \\n\\n27 \\n\\nOfficial \\n\\nSocial Security -- a stolen Social Security \\n\\nnumber on the I-9 and the tax withholding form, \\n\\nfor example, to conceal a criminal conviction or \\n\\nsex offender status. \\n\\nJUSTICE BREYER:  All that\\'s true, but \\n\\nthe allegation in the criminal cases here, I \\n\\nthink, were that the people, the defendants, \\n\\nwere aliens and that, moreover, they submitted \\n\\nthe information from the I-9 form -- it didn\\'t \\n\\nsay I-9 form, but it was from the I-9 form --\\n\\nand they submitted it to get a job.

What does \\n\\nthat mean? \\n\\nMR. MICHEL: I think that simply means \\n\\n-- that simply covers everything that\\'s on the \\n\\nI-9 form.  And that\\'s an effort by Congress to \\n\\ncover broadly everything that\\'s on the form, in \\n\\ncase there were some creative prosecutor who \\n\\nwanted to say, well, we\\'ve extracted piece of \\n\\nthe -- a piece of the I-9 and, therefore, we\\'re \\n\\nnot using the I-9 in violation of (b)(5). \\n\\nAnd even if this Court might not find \\n\\nthat a very persuasive argument, I think it \\n\\nmakes sense that Congress wanted to be doubly \\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation \\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n  \\n\\n \\n                                                                  \\n \\n \\n              \\n \\n               \\n \\n              \\n \\n              \\n \\n              \\n \\n              \\n \\n              \\n \\n              \\n \\n               \\n \\n              \\n \\n             \\n \\n              \\n \\n              \\n \\n               \\n \\n              \\n \\n              \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n              \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n\\n1  \\n\\n2  \\n\\n3  \\n\\n4  \\n\\n5  \\n\\n6  \\n\\n7  \\n\\n8  \\n\\n9  \\n\\n10  \\n\\n11  \\n\\n12  \\n\\n13  \\n\\n14  \\n\\n15  \\n\\n16  \\n\\n17  \\n\\n18  \\n\\n19  \\n\\n20  \\n\\n21  \\n\\n22  \\n\\n23  \\n\\n24  \\n\\n25  \\n\\n29 \\n\\nOfficial \\n\\nsure that they were covering the full form. \\n\\nJUSTICE ALITO: I -- I still don\\'t \\n\\nunderstand what you make of it and how it fits \\n\\nthe language of the statute.

So facts contained \\n\\nin the I-9 would be the name, the Social \\n\\nSecurity number, the address, all the facts that \\n\\nthe applicant for employment puts on the I-9. \\n\\nNow I agree that that -- it can\\'t mean \\n\\nthat.

Adopting the state\\'s argument, the \\n\\nCourt held that Kansas satisfied the \\n\\nrequirements of state law by proving that \\n\\nRespondents wrongfully showed that they were \\n\\neligible for employment. \\n\\nNow, according to the Kansas Supreme \\n\\nCourt, \"the state seeks to punish an alien who \\n\\nused the personal identifying information of \\n\\nanother to establish the alien\\'s work \\n\\nauthorization.\" \\n\\nIndeed, Kansas initially charged \\n\\nRespondents with fraud on the I-9.

In other words, \\n\\nwork authorization and applying to get a job \\n\\nare, as Mr. Michel told us, two different \\n\\nthings? \\n\\nMR. HUGHES: I think that\\'s \\n\\ninaccurate, Your Honor, because the way the \\n\\nstate prosecuted here was absolutely tethered to \\n\\nfederal work authorization. And there are a few \\n\\ndifferent ways that we know this is true. \\n\\nFirst, if the Court looks to the --\\n\\nthe brief that the state submitted --\\n\\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I don\\'t mean \\n\\nto -- just so I make sure where your head --\\n\\nthat we\\'re on the same page, so you would say \\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation \\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n  \\n\\n \\n                                                                  \\n \\n \\n              \\n \\n              \\n \\n              \\n \\n              \\n \\n               \\n \\n              \\n \\n              \\n \\n              \\n \\n              \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n\\n1  \\n\\n2  \\n\\n3  \\n\\n4  \\n\\n5  \\n\\n6  \\n\\n7  \\n\\n8  \\n\\n9  \\n\\n10  \\n\\n11  \\n\\n12  \\n\\n13  \\n\\n14  \\n\\n15  \\n\\n16    \\n\\n17  \\n\\n18  \\n\\n19  \\n\\n20  \\n\\n21  \\n\\n22  \\n\\n23  \\n\\n24  \\n\\n25  \\n\\n37 \\n\\nOfficial \\n\\nthat the Social Security number, even though \\n\\nit\\'s information contained on the I-9 in the \\n\\nprocess, can be used, say, to get a driver\\'s \\n\\nlicense but not to get a K-4? \\n\\nMR. HUGHES: Well, I -- I think that\\'s \\n\\nright, Your Honor. So, if this is tied to \\n\\nfederal work authorization, that is where \\n\\npreemption occurs.  And we know that that is the \\n\\ntheory of prosecution in these cases. \\n\\nJUSTICE KAVANAUGH: How are you \\n\\ndefining work authorization, just so I\\'m clear \\n\\non the answer to the Chief Justice\\'s question? \\n\\nMR. HUGHES: Yes, Your Honor. This is \\n\\nincorporated from federal law. So the question \\n\\nis, is an element of the offense that an \\n\\nindividual was showing as a matter of federal \\n\\nlaw that they were authorized for employment. \\n\\nIf that is the nature of the fraud, \\n\\nthen that is something that solely the federal \\n\\ngovernment is authorized to prosecute. \\n\\nIf it\\'s not that theory, our theory of \\n\\npreemption does not apply in those \\n\\ncircumstances. \\n\\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Hughes, give \\n\\nus some examples.

First, there are other ways \\n\\nto comply with the K-4 without using somebody \\n\\nelse\\'s Social Security number, including, for \\n\\nexample, using an I-10, an individual taxpayer \\n\\nidentification number. So that is a way that \\n\\nthat might happen. \\n\\nJUSTICE GORSUCH: But every time an \\n\\nemployee uses a false identification number in \\n\\nthese cases, Kansas will use a different set of \\n\\nmagical words, and that will be the end of this \\n\\nproblem? \\n\\nMR.

HUGHES: Your Honor, if there is \\n\\nan underlying targeting that is the intent \\n\\nbehind that law, I think that that might be \\n\\nsusceptible to other challenges, not the ones we \\n\\nbring here, but related to either constitutional \\n\\nclaims or selective enforcement or other kinds \\n\\nof challenges to that. \\n\\nThat is, by no stretch, the argument, \\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation \\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n  \\n\\n \\n                                                                  \\n \\n \\n              \\n \\n              \\n \\n              \\n \\n              \\n \\n              \\n \\n              \\n \\n              \\n \\n              \\n \\n              \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n\\n1  \\n\\n2  \\n\\n3  \\n\\n4  \\n\\n5  \\n\\n6  \\n\\n7  \\n\\n8  \\n\\n9  \\n\\n10  \\n\\n11  \\n\\n12  \\n\\n13  \\n\\n14  \\n\\n15  \\n\\n16  \\n\\n17  \\n\\n18  \\n\\n19  \\n\\n20  \\n\\n21  \\n\\n22  \\n\\n23  \\n\\n24  \\n\\n25  \\n\\n55 \\n\\nOfficial \\n\\nthough, that we press in this case. \\n\\nJUSTICE KAVANAUGH: So the specific --\\n\\nto follow up again on Justice Alito\\'s, the \\n\\nspecific reason that that\\'s not a conflict but \\n\\nthis case is a conflict is? \\n\\nMR. HUGHES: The specific reason is \\n\\nbecause the federal government establishes a \\n\\nuniform immigration policy with respect to who \\n\\nthey\\'re going to prosecute and who not, and that \\n\\nhas immigration consequences. \\n\\nBut, beyond that, I think our field \\n\\npreemption argument is an extraordinarily strong \\n\\none because all of the criteria that existed \\n\\nwith respect to Section 3 of SB 1070 are present \\n\\nhere. There is the exact same sort of \\n\\ncomprehensive and systematic system of \\n\\nimmigration, civil and criminal penalties. \\n\\nAnd only the federal government can \\n\\nexercise many of the forms of discretion that \\n\\nare baked into those enforcement mechanisms. So \\n\\njust to offer one example, it is a deportable \\n\\noffense to use false information in order to \\n\\nhave fraud on the federal employment \\n\\nverification system. \\n\\nHowever, there\\'s a discretionary \\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation \\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n  \\n\\n \\n                                                                  \\n \\n \\n              \\n \\n              \\n \\n              \\n \\n              \\n \\n              \\n \\n              \\n \\n              \\n \\n              \\n \\n              \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n              \\n \\n               \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n                 \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n\\n1  \\n\\n2  \\n\\n3  \\n\\n4  \\n\\n5  \\n\\n6  \\n\\n7  \\n\\n8  \\n\\n9  \\n\\n10  \\n\\n11  \\n\\n12  \\n\\n13  \\n\\n14  \\n\\n15  \\n\\n16  \\n\\n17  \\n\\n18  \\n\\n19  \\n\\n20  \\n\\n21  \\n\\n22  \\n\\n23  \\n\\n24  \\n\\n25  \\n\\n56 \\n\\nOfficial \\n\\nexception to that.

And we have said our rule --\\n\\nJUSTICE KAVANAUGH: Right. \\n\\nMR. HUGHES: -- that we think the \\n\\nCourt should adopt is that a state offense is \\n\\npreempted if an element of that is use of false \\n\\ninformation to show federal employment \\n\\nauthorization under the immigration laws. \\n\\nAnd the second question is the \\n\\napplicability of that in the context of this \\n\\ncase. Of course, that is something the Court \\n\\ncould leave for remand if the Court agrees and \\n\\nadopts our rule, which would be an appropriate \\n\\nway to do it, but I think it\\'s at least telling \\n\\nthat what the state has done in this case is \\n\\nbrought a prosecution that looks exactly like \\n\\nthe same prosecution if they were prosecuting \\n\\nfor fraud on the I-9 itself. \\n\\nAnd so we know that from 1324a(b)(5) \\n\\nthat Congress in enacting IRCA in 1986 made the \\n\\ndetermination that states may not prosecute \\n\\nfraud on the I-9 itself. \\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation \\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n  \\n\\n \\n                                                                  \\n \\n \\n              \\n \\n              \\n \\n              \\n \\n              \\n \\n                \\n \\n              \\n \\n              \\n \\n              \\n \\n              \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n              \\n \\n             \\n \\n              \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n\\n1  \\n\\n2  \\n\\n3  \\n\\n4  \\n\\n5  \\n\\n6  \\n\\n7  \\n\\n8  \\n\\n9  \\n\\n10  \\n\\n11  \\n\\n12  \\n\\n13  \\n\\n14  \\n\\n15  \\n\\n16  \\n\\n17  \\n\\n18  \\n\\n19  \\n\\n20  \\n\\n21  \\n\\n22  \\n\\n23  \\n\\n24  \\n\\n25  \\n\\n59 \\n\\nOfficial \\n\\nI think it would not do much to that \\n\\nstatute if states can prosecute the exact same \\n\\ntheory, the exact same kind of immigration \\n\\noffense, simply if they look at the K-4 or the \\n\\nW-4 forms and -- and -- and disclaim reliance on \\n\\nthe I-9. \\n\\nJUSTICE KAVANAUGH: I\\'m repeating \\n\\nmyself now, but you\\'ve said many times the state \\n\\ncould have a law prohibiting false statements on \\n\\nthe K-4. \\n\\nMR.

So there\\'s simply not the \\n\\ntheory of -- of prosecution that was available \\n\\nto Kansas in the facts of this case and not what \\n\\nit was that they, in -- in fact, advanced. \\n\\nSo, ultimately, again, we think that \\n\\nthis is a narrow case, that use of false \\n\\ninformation to show federal work authorization \\n\\nis the element that is preempted. \\n\\nIt\\'s a clear rule. It\\'s a rule that \\n\\nthe trial courts across the states can regularly \\n\\nimplement. We think it\\'s the only rule that \\n\\nactually gives effect to what Congress did in \\n\\n1324a(b)(5).

DEREK \\n\\nSCHMIDT ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER \\n\\nGENERAL SCHMIDT: Thank you, Mr. Chief \\n\\nJustice. \\n\\nI\\'d like to try to make three points. \\n\\nWith respect to Justice Alito\\'s line of \\n\\nquestioning on the (b)(5) language, (b)(5) is \\n\\ncertainly, if read as a preemption provision, \\n\\nmost unusual, at -- not least of which is \\n\\nbecause it is not aimed exclusively at states. \\n\\nPreemption is a supremacy clause concept that \\n\\nregulates the relationship between the federal \\n\\ngovernment and states. \\n\\nBut (b)(5) speaks not only to that but \\n\\nalso to the relationship between the law \\n\\nCongress passed and what the federal government \\n\\nmay do, and, most importantly, as I was \\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation \\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n  \\n\\n \\n                                                                  \\n \\n \\n              \\n \\n              \\n \\n              \\n \\n              \\n \\n              \\n \\n              \\n \\n                \\n \\n              \\n \\n              \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n               \\n \\n              \\n \\n              \\n \\n                  \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n\\n1  \\n\\n2  \\n\\n3  \\n\\n4  \\n\\n5  \\n\\n6  \\n\\n7  \\n\\n8  \\n\\n9  \\n\\n10  \\n\\n11  \\n\\n12  \\n\\n13  \\n\\n14  \\n\\n15  \\n\\n16  \\n\\n17  \\n\\n18  \\n\\n19  \\n\\n20  \\n\\n21  \\n\\n22  \\n\\n23  \\n\\n24  \\n\\n25  \\n\\n70 \\n\\nOfficial \\n\\ndiscussing earlier with Justice Kagan, what \\n\\nprivate employers may do with this information \\n\\nthat they were compelled to collect and maintain \\n\\nin a novel manner back in 1986. \\n\\nAnd we think that explains your \\n\\nearlier question, Justice Alito, with respect to \\n\\nwhat does \"information contained in\" mean. We \\n\\nthink it is an effort by Congress to make \\n\\nabsolutely clear, not just to states and not \\n\\njust to the federal government, but to millions \\n\\nof private employers who now must by command of \\n\\nfederal law maintain this private information, \\n\\nthat they may not use the form or information \\n\\nharvested from the form or information attached \\n\\nand submitted for the purpose of satisfying the \\n\\nrequirements of the form. We don\\'t think \\n\\nexpress preemption gets them there. \\n\\nSecond, with respect to the benefit \\n\\nquestion, which I think goes perhaps to -- I\\'m \\n\\nnot sure if it goes to conflict or -- or field, \\n\\nI\\'m a little uncertain about that -- but on the \\n\\nbenefit issue, I -- I -- I -- the -- the -- what \\n\\nwe agree is off limits is the I-9 system. \\n\\nWe aren\\'t arguing that Kansas \\n\\nprosecuted these individuals because they were \\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation \\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n  \\n\\n \\n                                                                  \\n \\n \\n              \\n \\n              \\n \\n              \\n \\n              \\n \\n              \\n \\n              \\n \\n              \\n \\n              \\n \\n              \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n              \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n\\n1  \\n\\n2  \\n\\n3  \\n\\n4  \\n\\n5  \\n\\n6  \\n\\n7  \\n\\n8  \\n\\n9  \\n\\n10  \\n\\n11  \\n\\n12  \\n\\n13  \\n\\n14  \\n\\n15  \\n\\n16  \\n\\n17  \\n\\n18  \\n\\n19  \\n\\n20  \\n\\n21  \\n\\n22  \\n\\n23  \\n\\n24  \\n\\n25  \\n\\n71 \\n\\nOfficial \\n\\ntrying to commit fraud on the I-9 system.  We\\'re \\n\\narguing that they defrauded folks whose \\n\\nidentities were stolen and that we used as \\n\\nevidence the W-4 and K-4 tax forms.  We didn\\'t \\n\\nuse the I-9 system. \\n\\nWith respect to the notion that \\n\\nsomehow preemption turns not on the intent of \\n\\nCongress but on the subjective intent of the \\n\\noffender, that turns preemption analysis on its \\n\\nhead. \\n\\nAnd a hypothetical I think that \\n\\nillustrates that, imagine that let\\'s say Mr. \\n\\nGarcia on the facts here were stopped for \\n\\nspeeding not because he was headed to a job he \\n\\nalready had but because he was headed with \\n\\ncompleted employment forms, applications in the \\n\\nback of his car, to apply for the job. \\n\\nHe still would be guilty of the same \\n\\nstate law crimes of identity theft. His intent \\n\\nwas to obtain the benefit of employment. But he \\n\\nnever arrived at the employer to apply for the \\n\\njob in the first place. That can\\'t be the test \\n\\nthat makes the difference here. \\n\\nAnd, finally, with respect to the --\\n\\nthe notion of what the state is asking for here, \\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation \\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n  \\n\\n \\n                                                                  \\n \\n \\n               \\n \\n              \\n \\n              \\n \\n              \\n \\n              \\n \\n              \\n \\n              \\n \\n              \\n \\n              \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n              \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n\\n1  \\n\\n2  \\n\\n3  \\n\\n4  \\n\\n5  \\n\\n6  \\n\\n7  \\n\\n8  \\n\\n9  \\n\\n10  \\n\\n11  \\n\\n12  \\n\\n13  \\n\\n14  \\n\\n15  \\n\\n16  \\n\\n17  \\n\\n18  \\n\\n19  \\n\\n20  \\n\\n21  \\n\\n22  \\n\\n23  \\n\\n24  \\n\\n25\\n\\n72 \\n\\nOfficial \\n\\nwe\\'re -- we\\'re a little unclear on exactly what \\n\\nfield our friends on the other side think is \\n\\npreempted. \\n\\nAs I suggested earlier, if there is \\n\\none, it has to be extremely narrow, the I-9 \\n\\nsystem itself, but we\\'re not sure a field exists \\n\\nthere because of the decision in Whiting that \\n\\nstates may compel the use of the E-Verify \\n\\nsystem, which certainly is part of work \\n\\nauthorization. \\n\\nSo this Court has never identified a \\n\\nfield and should not with respect to this case. \\n\\nThe conflict, we don\\'t see. The conflict that \\n\\nwas present in Arizona, as we discussed earlier, \\n\\nis not present here. This is a fundamentally \\n\\ndifferent case. \\n\\nKansas is not trying to act as an \\n\\nimmigration enforcer but to enforce our \\n\\ngenerally applicable identity theft laws. \\n\\nThank you. \\n\\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, \\n\\ncounsel.

Look for words or phrases that uniquely repeat at the beginning and at the end of the arguments. The easiest way to isolate this, to do a simple split() on one of those phrases, and keep the half of The split you want.
